  - Basic control structures (if/else, loops).

### Week 2: Functions and Modules
- Writing reusable code with functions.
- Importing and using Python modules.
- Topics covered:
  - Function definitions, arguments, and return values.
  - Built-in modules like `math` and `random`.

### Week 3: Data Structures
- Introduction to Python data structures.
- Topics covered:
  - Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.
  - Iterating through data structures.
  - Common operations and methods.

### Week 4: File Handling
- Reading from and writing to files.
- Topics covered:
  - Working with text and CSV files.
  - File modes (`r`, `w`, `a`).
  - Exception handling.

### Week 5: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Introduction to OOP concepts in Python.
- Topics covered:

  - DataFrames and Series.
  - Data cleaning and manipulation.
  - Aggregation and grouping.

### Week 8: Final Project - COVID-19 Global Data Tracker
- A comprehensive data analysis project using real-world COVID-19 data.
- **Project Objectives**:
  - Import and clean COVID-19 global data.
  - Analyze trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations).
  - Compare metrics across countries/regions.
  - Visualize trends with charts and maps.
  - Build an interactive dashboard using `ipywidgets`.
- **Data Source**:
  - [Our World in Data COVID-19 Dataset](https://github.com/Brian-Masheti/Feb-2025-Python-Sessions.git).
