# Instructions: Analyzing Data with Pandas and Visualizing Results with Matplotlib

## 📌 Objective

- Load and analyze a dataset using the **pandas** library in Python  
- Create simple plots and charts using the **matplotlib** library to visualize the data

---

## 📂 Submission Requirements

Submit either a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) or Python script (`.py`) file containing:

- ✅ Data loading and exploration steps  
- ✅ Basic data analysis results  
- ✅ Visualizations  
- ✅ Any findings or observations  

---

## 🧪 Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset

1. Choose a dataset in **CSV format** (e.g., Iris dataset, sales dataset, or any dataset of your choice)
2. Load the dataset using `pandas`
3. Display the first few rows using `.head()` to inspect the data
4. Check the structure of the dataset (data types, missing values)
5. Clean the data by filling or dropping missing values

---

## 📊 Task 2: Basic Data Analysis

1. Use `.describe()` to compute summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.)
2. Group by a categorical column (e.g., species, region) and compute the mean of a numerical column
3. Identify any patterns or interesting insights from your analysis

---

## 📈 Task 3: Data Visualization

Create **at least four** different types of plots:

- **Line chart** – Trends over time (e.g., sales over time)
- **Bar chart** – Comparison of categories (e.g., average petal length per species)
- **Histogram** – Distribution of a numerical column
- **Scatter plot** – Relationship between two numerical variables (e.g., sepal length vs. petal length)

**Customize your plots with:**

- Titles  
- Axis labels  
- Legends (if applicable)

## 📝 Notes

- Write clean, readable, and well-commented code  
- Make sure all visualizations are clearly labeled and easy to interpret  
- Highlight key findings or insights from your data analysis
