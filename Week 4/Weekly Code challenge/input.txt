A good Power BI dashboard should present data in a visually appealing yet straightforward manner. 
It integrates relevant, actionable insights, prioritizing key performance indicators (KPIs) for immediate attention. 
Interactivity is paramount; users can filter and sort data to reveal deeper trends. 
Dashboards must be responsive, adapting to various devices without losing effectiveness. 
Color choices and typography should enhance comprehension, not detract from it.
