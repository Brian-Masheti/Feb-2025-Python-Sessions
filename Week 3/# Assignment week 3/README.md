# Week 3 Python Assignment README

## Instructions

### Task:
Create a Python program that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount if the discount is 20% or higher. If the discount is below 20%, the original price should remain unchanged. The program should prompt the user to enter the original price and the discount percentage, then print the final price or original price as appropriate.

### Function:
Define a function named `calculate_discount` that takes two parameters:
- `price`: The original price of the item.
- `discount_percent`: The discount percentage as a number (e.g., 20 for 20%).

The function should return the final price after applying the discount if the discount is 20% or higher, or it should return the original price if the discount is below 20%.
